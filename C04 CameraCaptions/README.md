# Challenge 4 for #100DaysOfSwift

## Milestone: Projects 10-12

## Camera Captions

Your challenge is to put two different projects into one: Iâ€™d like you to let users take photos of things that interest them, add captions to them, then show those photos in a table view. Tapping the caption should show the picture in a new view controller, like we did with project 1
