# Project 11 for #100DaysOfSwift

## Pachinko Sprite Kit Game

The challenges for this project were:

1. The pictures we’re using in have other ball pictures rather than just “ballRed”. Try writing code to use a random ball color each time they tap the screen.

2. Right now, users can tap anywhere to have a ball created there, which makes the game too easy. Try to force the Y value of new balls so they are near the top of the screen.

3. I made my own personal changes to this game.
