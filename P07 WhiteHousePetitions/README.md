# Project 7 for #100DaysOfSwift

## WhiteHousePetitions

The challenges for this project were:

1. Add a Credits button to the top-right corner using UIBarButtonItem. When this is tapped, show an alert telling users the data comes from the We The People API of the Whitehouse.

2. Let users filter the petitions they see. This involves creating a second array of filtered items that contains only petitions matching a string the user entered.

3. Experiment with the HTML – this isn’t a HTML or CSS tutorial, but you can find lots of resources online to give you enough knowledge to tinker with the layout a little.
