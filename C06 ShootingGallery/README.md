# Challenge 6 for #100DaysOfSwift

## Milestone: Projects 16-18

## Shooting Gallery

This time your challenge is to make a shooting gallery game using SpriteKit: create three rows on the screen, then have targets slide across from one side to the other. If the user taps a target, make it fade out and award them points.
