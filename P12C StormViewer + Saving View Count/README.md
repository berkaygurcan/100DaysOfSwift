# Project 12C for #100DaysOfSwift

## Storm Viewer + Saving View Count

Challenge 1:

Modify project 1 so that it remembers how many times each storm image was shown – you don’t need to show it anywhere, but you’re welcome to try modifying your original copy of project 1 to show the view count as a subtitle below each image name in the table view.
