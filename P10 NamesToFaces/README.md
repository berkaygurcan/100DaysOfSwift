# Project 10 for #100DaysOfSwift

## Names To Faces

The challenges for this project were:

1. Add a second UIAlertController that gets shown when the user taps a picture, asking them whether they want to rename the person or delete them.

2. Try using picker.sourceType = .camera when creating your image picker, which will tell it to create a new image by taking a photo. This is only available on devices (not on the simulator) so you might want to check the return value of UIImagePickerController.isSourceTypeAvailable() before trying to use it!
