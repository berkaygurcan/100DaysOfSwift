## Detect-A-Beacon

Challenges:

1. Write code that shows a UIAlertController when your beacon is first detected.

2. Go through two or three other iBeacons in the Detect Beacon app and add their UUIDs to your app, then register all of them with iOS. Now add a second label to the app that shows new text depending on which beacon was located.

3.  Add a circle to your view, then use animation to scale it up and down depending on the distance from the beacon.
