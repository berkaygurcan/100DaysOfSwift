# Challenge 5 for #100DaysOfSwift

## Milestone: Projects 13-15

## Country Facts

Your challenge is to make an app that contains facts about countries: show a list of country names in a table view, then when one is tapped bring in a new screen that contains its capital city, size, population, currency, and any other facts that interest you.
