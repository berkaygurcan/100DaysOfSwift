# Project 28 for #100DaysOfSwift

## Secret Swift

Challenges:

1. Add a Done button as a navigation bar item that causes the app to re-lock immediately rather than waiting for the user to quit. This should only be shown when the app is unlocked.

2. Create a password system for your app so that the Touch ID/Face ID fallback is more useful.
