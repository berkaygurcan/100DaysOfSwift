# Project 20 for #100DaysOfSwift

## Fireworks Night

Challenges for this project:

1. For an easy challenge try adding a score label that updates as the playerâ€™s score changes.

2. Make the game end after a certain number of launches. You will need to use the invalidate() method of Timer to stop it from repeating.

3. Use the waitForDuration and removeFromParent actions in a sequence to make sure explosion particle emitters are removed from the game scene when they are finished.
