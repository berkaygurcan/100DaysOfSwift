# Challenge 10 for #100DaysOfSwift

## Milestone: Projects 28-30

## Pairs App

Your challenge is to create a memory pairs game that has players find pairs of cards – it’s sometimes called Concentration, Pelmanism, or Pairs. At the very least you should:

- Come up with a list of pairs. Traditionally this is two pictures, but you could also use capital cities (e.g. one card says France and its match says Paris), languages (e.g one card says “hello” and the other says “bonjour”), and so on.
- Show a grid of face-down cards. How many is down to you, but if you’re targeting iPad I would have thought 4x4 or more.
- Let the player select any two cards, and show them face up as they are tapped.
- If they match remove them; if they don’t match, wait a second then turn them face down again.
- Show a You Win message once all are matched.

If you’re looking for a more advanced challenge, go for a variant of the game that uses word pairs and add a parental option that lets them create new cards. This would mean:

- Authenticating users using Touch ID or Face ID.
- Showing a new view controller that lists all existing cards and lets them enter a new card.
