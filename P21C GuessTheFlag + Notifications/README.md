# Project 21 for #100DaysOfSwift

## Local Notifications

Challenge 3

And for an even harder challenge, update project 2 so that it reminds players to come back and play every day. This means scheduling a week of notifications ahead of time, each of which launch the app. When the app is finally launched, make sure you call removeAllPendingNotificationRequests() to clear any un-shown alerts, then make new alerts for future days.
